### Introduction

Every application need to store some settings and use these settings in
somewhere in the application. ASP.NET Boilerplate provides a strong
infrastructure to store/retrieve **application**, **tenant** and
**user** level settings usable both in **server** and **client** sides.

A setting is a **name-value string** pair that is generally stored in a
database (or another source). We can store non-string values by
converting to string.

#### About ISettingStore

**ISettingStore** interface must be implemented in order to use setting
system. While you can implement it in your own way, it's fully
implemented in **module-zero** project. If it's not implemented,
settings are read from application's **configuration file** (web.config
or app.config) but can not change any setting. Also, scoping will not
work.

### Defining settings

A setting must be defined before usage. ASP.NET Boilerplate is designed
to be [modular](/Pages/Documents/Module-System). So, different modules
can have different settings. A module should create a class derived from
**SettingProvider** in order to define it's settings. An example setting
provider is shown below:

    public class MySettingProvider : SettingProvider
    {
        public override IEnumerable<SettingDefinition> GetSettingDefinitions(SettingDefinitionProviderContext context)
        {
            return new[]
                    {
                        new SettingDefinition(
                            "SmtpServerAddress",
                            "127.0.0.1"
                            ),

                        new SettingDefinition(
                            "PassiveUsersCanNotLogin",
                            "true",
                            scopes: SettingScopes.Application | SettingScopes.Tenant
                            ),

                        new SettingDefinition(
                            "SiteColorPreference",
                            "red",
                            scopes: SettingScopes.User,
                            isVisibleToClients: true
                            )

                    };
        }
    }

**GetSettingDefinitions** method should return **SettingDefinition**
objects. SettingDefinition class has some parameters in it's
constructor:

-   **Name** (required): A setting must have a system-wide **unique**
    name. It's good idea to define a const string for a setting name
    instead of a magic string.
-   **Default value**: A setting may have a default value. This value
    can be null or empty string.
-   **Scopes**: A setting should define it's scope (see below).
-   **Display name**: A localizable string that can be used to show
    setting's name later in UI.
-   **Description**: A localizable string that can be used to show
    setting's description later in UI.
-   **Group**: Can be used to group settings. This is just for UI, not
    used in setting management.
-   **IsVisibleToClients**: Set true to make a setting usable on the
    client side.
-   **isInherited**: Used to set if this setting is inherited by tenant
    and users (See setting scope section).
-   **customData**: Can be used to set a custom data for this setting
    definition.

After creating a setting provider, we should register it in PreIntialize
method of our module:

    Configuration.Settings.Providers.Add<MySettingProvider>();

Setting providers are registered to [dependency
injection](/Pages/Documents/Dependency-Injection) automatically. So, a
setting provider can inject any dependency (like a repository) to build
setting definitions using some other sources.

#### Setting scope

Â There are three **setting scopes** (or levels) defined in
**SettingScopes** enum:

-   **Application**: An application scoped setting is used for
    user/tenant independed settings. For example, we can define a
    setting named "SmtpServerAddress" to get server's IP address when
    sending emails. If this setting has a single value (not changes
    based on users), then we can define it as Application scoped.
-   **Tenant**: If the application is multi-tenant, we can define
    tenant-specific settings.
-   **User**: We can use a user scoped setting to store/get value of the
    setting specific to each user.

SettingScopes enum has **Flags** attribute, so we can define a setting
with **more than one scopes**.

Setting scope is **hierarchic** by default (unless you set
**isInherited** to false). For example, if we define a setting's scope
as "Application | Tenant | User" and try to get **current value** of the
the setting;

-   We get the user-specific value if it's defined (overrided) for the
    user.
-   If not, we get the tenant-specific value if it's defined (overrided)
    for the tenant.
-   If not, we get the application value if it's defined.
-   If not, we get the **default value**.

Default value can be **null** or **empty** string. It's adviced to
provide default values for settings where it's possible.

#### Overriding Setting Definitions

context.Manager can be used to get a setting definition to change it's
values. In this way, you can manipulate setting definitions of [depended
modules](Module-System.md).

### Getting setting values

After defining a setting, we can get it's current value both in server
and client.

#### Server side

**ISettingManager** is used to perform setting operations. We can inject
and use it anywhere in the application. ISettingManager defines many
methods to get a setting's value.

Most used method is **GetSettingValue** (or GetSettingValueAsync for
async call). It returns **current value** of the setting based on
default value, application, tenant and user settings (as described in
Setting scope section before). Examples:

    //Getting a boolean value (async call)
    var value1 = await SettingManager.GetSettingValueAsync<bool>("PassiveUsersCanNotLogin");

    //Getting a string value (sync call)
    var value2 = SettingManager.GetSettingValue("SmtpServerAddress");
                

GetSettingValue has generic and async versions as shown above. There are
also methods to get a specific tenant or user's setting value or list of
all setting values.

Since ISettingManager is widely used, some special **base classes**
(like ApplicationService, DomainService and AbpController) has a
property named **SettingManager**. If we derived from these classes, no
need to explicitly inject it.

#### Client side

If you set **IsVisibleToClients** as true while defining a setting, then
you can get it's current value in the client side using javascript.
**abp.setting** namespace defines needed functions and objects. Example:

    var currentColor = abp.setting.get("SiteColorPreference");

There is also **getInt** and **getBoolean** methods. You can get all
values using **abp.setting.values** object. Note that; If you change a
setting in server side, clienct can not know this change unless page is
refreshed, settings are somehow reloaded or it's manually updated by
code.

### Changing settings

ISettingManager defines **ChangeSettingForApplicationAsync**,
**ChangeSettingForTenantAsync** and **ChangeSettingForUserAsync**
methods (and sync versions) to change settings for the application, for
a tenant and for a user respectively.

### About caching

Setting Manager caches settings on the server side. So, we should not
directly change a setting value using repository or database update
query.

### What Is Multi Tenancy?

"*Software* ***Multitenancy*** *refers to a software* ***architecture***
*in which a* ***single instance*** *of a software runs on a server and
serves* ***multiple tenants****. A tenant is a group of users who share
a common access with specific privileges to the software instance. With
a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to
provide every tenant a* ***dedicated share of the instance including its
data****, configuration, user management, tenant individual
functionality and non-functional properties. Multitenancy contrasts with
multi-instance architectures, where separate software instances operate
on behalf of different tenants*"
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy))

In brief, multi-tenancy is a technique that is used to create **SaaS**
(Software as-a Service) applications.

#### Database & Deployment Architectures

There are some different multi-tenant database & deployment approaches:

##### Multiple Deployment - Multiple Database

This is **not multi tenancy** actually. But, if we run **one instance**
of the application **for each** customer (tenant) with a **seperated
database**, we can serve to **multiple tenants** in a single server. We
just make sure that multiple instance of the application don't
**conflict** with each other in same server environment.

This can be possible also for an **existing application** which is not
designed as multitenant. It's easier to create such an application since
the application has not aware of multitenancy. But there are setup,
utilization and maintenance problems in this approach.

##### Single Deployment - Multiple Database

ln this approach, we may run a **single instance** of the application in
a server. We have a **master** (host) database to store tenant metadata
(like tenant name and subdomain) and a **seperated database** for each
tenant. Once we identify the **current tenant** (for example; from
subdomain or from a user login form), then we can **switch** to that
tenant's database to perform operations.

In this approach, application should be designed as multi-tenant in some
level. But most of the application can remain independed from
multi-tenancy.

We should create and maintain a **seperated database** for each tenant,
this includes **database migrations**. If we have many customers with
dedicated databases, it may take long time to migrate database schema in
an application update. Since we have seperated database for a tenant, we
can **backup** it's database seperately from other tenants. Also, we can
**move** the tenant database to a stronger server if that tenant needs
it.

##### Single Deployment - Single Database

This is the most **real multi-tenancy** architecture: We only deploy
**single instance** of the application with a **single database** into a
**single server**. We have a **TenantId** (or similar) field in each
table (for a RDBMS) which is used to isolate a tenant's data from
others.

This is easy to setup and maintain. But harder to create such an
application. Because, we must prevent a Tenant to read or write other
tenant data. We may add **TenantId filter** for each database read
(select) operation. Also, we may check it every write, if this entity is
related to the **current tenant**. This is tedious and error-prone. But
ASP.NET Boilerplate helps us here by using **automatic [data
filtering](Data-Filters.md)**.

This approach may have performance problems if we have many tenants with
huge data. We may use table partitioning or other database features to
overcome this problem.

##### Single Deployment - Hybrid Databases

We may want to store tenants in single databases normally, but want to
create seperated databases for desired tenants. For example, we can
store tenants with big data in their own databases, but store all other
tenants in a single database.

##### Multiple Deployment - Single/Multiple/Hybrid Database

Finally, we may want to deploy our application to more than one server
(like web farms) for a better application performance, high
availability, and/or scalability. This is independent from the database
approach.

### Multi-Tenancy in ASP.NET Boilerplate

ASP.NET Boilerplate can work with all scenarios described above.

#### Enabling Multi Tenancy

Multi-tenancy is disabled by default. We can enable it in PreInitialize
of our module as shown below:

    Configuration.MultiTenancy.IsEnabled = true;Â 

#### Host vs Tenant

First, we should define two terms used in a multi-tenant system:

-   **Tenant**: A customer which have it's own users, roles,
    permissions, settings... and uses the application completely
    isolated from other tenants. A multi-tenant application will have
    one or more tenants. If this is a CRM application, different tenants
    have also thier own accounts, contacts, products and orders. So,
    when we say a '**tenant user**', we mean a user owned by a tenant.
-   **Host**: Host is singleton (there is a single host). The Host is
    responsible to create and manage tenants. So, a '**host user**' is
    higher level and independent from all tenants and can control they.

#### Session

ASP.NET Boilerplate defines **IAbpSession** interface to obtain current
**user** and **tenant** ids. This interface is used in multi-tenancy to
get current tenant's id by default. Thus, it can filter data based on
current tenant's id. We can say these rules:

-   If both of UserId and TenantId is null, then current user is **not
    logged in** to the system. So, we can not know if it's a host user
    or tenant user. In this case, user can not access to
    [authorized](/Pages/Documents/Authorization) content.
-   If UserId is not null and TenantId is null, then we can know that
    current user is a **host user**.
-   If UserId is not null and also TenantId is not null, we can know
    that current user is a **tenant user**.
-   If UserId is null but TenantId is not null, that means we can know
    the current tenant, but current request is not authorized (user did
    not login). See the next section to understand how current tenant is
    determined.

See [session documentation](/Pages/Documents/Abp-Session) for more
information on the session.

#### Determining Current Tenant

Since all tenant users use the same application, we should have a way of
distinguishing the tenant of the current request. Default session
implementation (ClaimsAbpSession) uses different approaches to find the
tenant related to the current request with the given order:

1.  If user has logged in, then gets TenantId from current claims. Claim
    name is *http://www.aspnetboilerplate.com/identity/claims/tenantId*
    and should contain an integer value. If it's not found in claims
    then the user is assumed as a *host* user.
2.  If user has not logged in, then it tries to resolve TenantId from
    *tenant resolve contributor*s. There are 3 pre-defined tenant
    contributors and runs in given order (first success resolver wins):
    1.  **DomainTenantResolveContributer**: Tries to resolve tenancy
        name from url, generally from domain or subdomain. You can
        configure domain format in PreInitialize method of your module
        (like
        Configuration.Modules.AbpWebCommon().MultiTenancy.DomainFormat =
        "{0}.mydomain.com";). If domain format is "{0}.mydomain.com" and
        current host of the request is ***acme**.mydomain.com*, then
        tenancy name is resolved as "acme". Then next step is to query
        ITenantStore to find the TenantId by given tenancy name. If a
        tenant is found, then it's resolved as the current TenantId.
    2.  **HttpHeaderTenantResolveContributer**: Tries to resolve
        TenantId from "Abp.TenantId" header value, if present (This is a
        constant defined in
        Abp.MultiTenancy.MultiTenancyConsts.TenantIdResolveKey).
    3.  **HttpCookieTenantResolveContributer**: Tries to resolve
        TenantId from "Abp.TenantId" cookie value, if present (uses the
        same constant explained above).

If none of these attemtps can resolve a TenantId, then current requester
is considered as the host. Tenant resolvers are extensible. You can add
resolvers to **Configuration.MultiTenancy.Resolvers** collection, or
remove an existing resolver.

One last thing on resolvers is that; resolved tenant id is cached during
the same request for performance reasons. So, resolvers are executed
once in a request (and only if current user has not already logged in).

##### Tenant Store

**DomainTenantResolveContributer** uses ITenantStore to find tenant id
by tenancy name. Default implementation of **ITenantStore** is
**NullTenantStore** which does not contain any tenant and returns null
for queries. You can implement and replace it to query tenants from any
data source. [Module zero](Zero/Overall.md) properly implements it to
get from it's [tenant manager](Zero/Tenant-Management.md). So, if you
are using module zero, don't care about the tenant store.

#### Data Filters

For **multi tenant single database** approach, we must add a
**TenantId** filter to get only current tenant's entities while
retrieving [entities](/Pages/Documents/Entities) from database. ASP.NET
Boilerplate automatically does it when you implement one of two
interfaces for your entity: **IMustHaveTenant** and **IMayHaveTenant**.

##### IMustHaveTenant Interface

This interface is used to distinguish entities of different tenants by
defining **TenantId** property. An example entitiy that implements
IMustHaveTenant:

    public class Product : Entity, IMustHaveTenant
    {
        public int TenantId { get; set; }
    
        public string Name { get; set; }
    
        //...other properties
    }

Thus, ASP.NET Boilerplate knows that this is a tenant-specific entity
and automatically isolates entities of a tenant from other tenants.

##### IMayHaveTenant interface

We may need to share an **entity type** between host and tenants. So, an
entity may be owned by a tenant or the host. IMayHaveTenant interface
also defines **TenantId** (similar to IMustHaveTenant), but **nullable**
in this case. An example entitiy that implements IMayHaveTenant:

    public class Role : Entity, IMayHaveTenant
    {
        public int? TenantId { get; set; }
    
        public string RoleName { get; set; }
    
        //...other properties
    }

We may use same Role class to store Host roles and Tenant roles. In this
case, TenantId property says if this is an host entity or tenant
entitiy. A **null** value means this is a **host** entity, a
**non-null** value means this entity owned by a **tenant** which's Id is
the **TenantId**.

##### Additional Notes

IMayHaveTenant is not common as IMustHaveTenant. For example, a Product
class can not be IMayHaveTenant since a Product is related to actual
application functionality, not related to managing tenants. So, use
IMayHaveTenant interface carefully since it's harder to maintain a code
shared by host and tenants.

When you define an entity type as IMustHaveTenant or IMayHaveTenant,
**always set TenantId** when you create a new entity (While ASP.NET
Boilerplate tries to set it from current TenantId, it may not be
possible in some cases, especially for IMayHaveTenant entities). Most of
times, this will be the only point you deal with TenantId properties.
You don't need to explicitly write TenantId filter in Where conditions
while writing LINQ, since it will be automatically filtered.

#### Switching Between Host and Tenants

While working on a multitenant application database, we should know the
**current tenant**. By default, it's obtained from
[IAbpSession](Abp-Session.md) (as described before). We can change
this behaviour and switch to other tenant's database. Example:

    public class ProductService : ITransientDependency
    {
        private readonly IRepository<Product> _productRepository;
        private readonly IUnitOfWorkManager _unitOfWorkManager;
    
        public ProductService(IRepository<Product> productRepository, IUnitOfWorkManager unitOfWorkManager)
        {
            _productRepository = productRepository;
            _unitOfWorkManager = unitOfWorkManager;
        }
    
        [UnitOfWork]
        public virtual List<Product> GetProducts(int tenantId)
        {
            using (_unitOfWorkManager.Current.SetTenantId(tenantId))
            {
                return _productRepository.GetAllList();
            }
        }
    }

SetTenantId ensures that we are working on given tenant data,
independent from database architecture:

-   If given tenant has a dedicated database, it switches to that
    database and gets products from it.
-   If given tenant has not a dedicated database (single database
    approach, for example), it adds automatic TenantId filter to query
    get only that tenant's products.

If we don't use SetTenantId, it gets tenantId from
[session](Abp-Session.md), as said before. There are some notes and
best practices here:

-   Use **SetTenantId(null)** to switch to the host.
-   Use SetTenantId within a **using** block as in the example if there
    is not a special case. Thus, it automatically restore tenantId at
    the end of the using block and the code calls GetProducts method
    works as before.
-   You can use SetTenantId in **nested blocks** if it's needed.
-   Since **\_unitOfWorkManager.Current** only available in a [unit of
    work](Unit-Of-Work.md), be sure that your code runs in a UOW.

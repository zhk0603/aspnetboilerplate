### Introduction

While some applications target a single timezone, some others target to
many different timezones. To satisfy such needs and centralize datetime
operations, Abp provides common infrastructure for datetime operations.

### Clock

**Clock** is the main class used to work with **DateTime** values. It
defines the following **static** properties/methods:

-   **Now**: Gets current time according to current provider.
-   **Kind**: Gets DateTimeKind of current provider.
-   **SupportsMultipleTimezone**: Gets a value indicates that current
    provider can be used for applications need to multiple timezones.
-   **Normalize**: Normalizes/converts given DateTime upon current
    provider.

So, instead of using *DateTime.Now*, we are using **Clock.Now**, which
abstracts it:

    DateTime now = Clock.Now;

Clock uses clock providers inside it. There are three types of
**built-in clock providers**:

-   **ClockProviders.Unspecified** (UnspecifiedClockProvider): This is
    the **default** clock provider and behaives just like
    **DateTime.Now**. It acts as you don't use Clock class at all.
-   **ClockProviders.Utc** (UtcClockProvider): Works in UTC datetime.
    **DateTime.UtcNow** for Clock.Now. Normalize method converts a given
    datetime to utc datetime and set it's kind to DateTimeKind.UTC. It
    **supports multiple timezones**.
-   **ClockProviders.Local** (LocalClockProvider): Works in Local
    computer's time. Normalize method converts a given datetime to local
    datetime and set it's kind to DateTimeKind.Local.

You can set Clock.Provider in order to use a different clock provider:

    Clock.Provider = ClockProviders.Utc;

This is generally done at the beginning of an application (proper to do
it Application\_Start in a web application).

#### Client Side

Clock can be used on the client side by **abp.clock** object in
javascript. When you set Clock.Provider on the server side, ABP
automatically sets value of **abp.clock.provider** on the client side.

### Time Zones

ABP defines a [setting](Setting-Management.md) named
**Abp.Timing.TimeZone** (*TimingSettingNames.TimeZone* constant) for
storing selected timezone of host, tenant and user. ABP assumes that
value of timezone setting is a valid **Windows timezone name**. It also
defines a timezone mapping file to convert a Windows Timezone to
**IANA** timezone since some of the common libraries are using IANA
timezone id. **UtcClockProvider** must be used in order to support
**multiple timezones**. Because if UtcClockProvider is used, all
datetime values will be stored in UTC and all datetimes will be sent to
clients in UTC format. Then on the client side we can convert UTC
datetime to user's timezone by using user's current timezone setting.Â 

#### Client Side

ABP creates an javascript object named **abp.timing.timeZoneInfo** which
contains timezone information for current user. This information
contains Windows and IANA timezone ids and some extra information for
windows timezone info. This information can be used to make client side
datetime convertions and showing a datetime to user in his/her timezone.

### Binders and Converters

-   ABP automatically normalizes DateTimes received from **clients** in
    MVC, Web API and ASP.NET Core applications, based on the current
    clock provider.
-   ABP automatically normalized DateTimes received from **database**
    based on the current clock provider, when
    [EntityFramework](EntityFramework-Integration.md) or
    [NHibernate](NHibernate-Integration.md) modules used.

If UTC clock provider is used, then all DateTimes stored in database
assumed as UTC values, and all DateTimes received from clients assumed
as UTC unless it's explicitly specified.
